# Homepage Heading Size Design

## Goal

Reduce the visual size of the homepage section headings so the Featured Categories, Best Sellers, and Newly Added sections have more breathing room without changing the hero or product-card typography.

## Design

- Apply one reduced responsive heading scale to the three section heading groups.
- Reduce the mobile heading range by about 10%, from `1.5rem–2.4rem` to `1.35rem–2.15rem`.
- Reduce the desktop heading range by about 10%, from `1.65rem–2.6rem` to `1.5rem–2.35rem`.
- Keep Bengali highlighted words italic, gold, and aligned with their English heading counterparts.
- Preserve section spacing, line breaks, links, animation, and all non-heading typography.

## Verification

- Add source-level regression assertions for the reduced shared scales.
- Run the focused homepage tests.
- Run the TypeScript check, production build, and whitespace validation.
