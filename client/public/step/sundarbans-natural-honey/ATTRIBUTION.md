# Sundarbans Natural Honey — campaign media attribution

No authentic campaign media has been supplied yet. Nothing in this folder is
generated or fabricated as proof: sections that require missing originals ship
as honest text-first layout, and the review section is omitted entirely until
genuine reviews with display permission arrive.

The bottle image on the page is the live Supabase product image served through
the Merchant Suite catalog API. It is not duplicated in `client/public`.

## Reviews ship-gate (explicit approval required)

The omitted review section is not auto-shippable. Per the spec (Error and
edge states), shipping without genuine reviews needs explicit stakeholder approval. Status: pending — no approval invented or assumed. Code gate:
`honeyReviewsShipGate` in
`client/src/features/sundarbans-honey/content.ts` (`shipped: false`). Task 9
must not claim shippable without flipping that gate with both genuine reviews
and recorded approval.

## First asset request

Please supply, individually:

1. Sundarbans river/forest hero original, at least 2400px wide
2. Real natural hive photo
3. Real honey collection photo
4. Real collection video, highest-quality original
